# Transition Properties

Investigation of Transition Properties (e.g. Background Colour and Width).

## UX

As the mouse pointer is hovered over the box, the background colour is blue and the width of the box is 150px.
As the mouse pointer moves away from the box, it returns to its original state (background colour - green, width - 50px).
